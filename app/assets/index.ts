/**
 * Commerce Sprinkle - Vue.js Assets
 *
 * Main entry point for Commerce sprinkle frontend components
 *
 * This module exposes:
 * - a default export that is a Vue plugin (so `app.use(Commerce)` works)
 * - named exports for components/composables/interfaces/pages/routes
 */

/**
 * Default plugin export so other parts of the app can `app.use(Commerce)`.
 * Currently this plugin is a no-op â€” most sprinkles register Vue global
 * components or plugins here. If you later add a client-side plugin
 * (e.g. for cart state), register it in this install function.
